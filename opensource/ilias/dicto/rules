 * The php function eval() is not good practice. Its use often comes with a high security risk, because it is generally not a trivial task to make sure that a paramater of eval() can be fully trusted. And if it is, then eval() is usually not neccessary. It is also tricky to debug, because it obfuscates control flow. Last but not least, it does not work with HHVM in the special "RepoAuthoritative" mode, which makes PHP run extra-fast.
